$ENTRY_JOURNAL_INTRO_LEFT_00	1º giorno - Dove sono?
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_INTRO_LEFT_10	Probabilmente sono impazzita, ma cercherò nondimeno di registrare gli eventi che si stanno svolgendo davanti ai miei occhi. Il lettore potrà trarre le sue conclusioni; io mi limiterò semplicemente a descrivere gli avvenimenti come percepiti dalla mia mente febbricitante.<N>So per certa di aver contratto la piaga che sta devastando la nostra splendida capitale. So anche che, come gli altri malati prima di me, sono stata portata fuori dalla citta e gettata nella Valle. Da lì si è succeduta una serie di eventi così strani e terrificanti che ancora mi chiedo se non stia sognando.<N>Quando mi colse la febbre, mi destai in un luogo oscuro. Dinanzi a me si trovava un'altra vittima.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_INTRO_RIGHT_00	Là apparse un magnifico trono, e su di esso sedeva un uomo, diverso da chiunque avessi mai visto prima. Splendente d'oro dalla testa ai piedi. Inizialmente pensai che dovesse essere una statua, ma nell'istante successivo lo udii lanciare un ordine.<N>La sua voce era anch'essa dorata, e le sue parole crepitavano con il potere del tuono. Era un linguaggio completamente sconosciuto, ma il mio corpo scattò al suo comando. Sentii le mie vene tendersi come se il sangue volesse erompere dal mio corpo e precipitarsi al suo fianco.<N>Al solo pensarci, il cuore riprende a battermi all'impazzata. <N>-[mcguffin_hero] Livbar
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_0_00	1º notte - [berserker_hero]
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_0_10	Mentre mi accingo a scrivere di [berserker_hero], mi accorgo di dover abbandonare l'austero linguaggio della capitale, per adottare un vernacolo più consono all'argomento. [berserker_hero] è un cretino integrale. È la quintessenza della cretinaggine. Chiamarlo cretino è un insulto a tutti gli altri cretini.<N>Ciò che gli manca sul piano intellettuale, però, lo compensa con l'odore. Se due cumuli di letame bruciato potessero accoppiarsi e generare dei discendenti, la loro putrida progenie scapperebbe di fronte fetore emanato dalle ascelle di [berserker_hero]. In verità, i cadaveri animati che ci danno la caccia hanno al confronto uno squisito profumo. Ma [berserker_hero] è più di un bel faccino. Possiede anche una personalità vincente che io posso solo descrivere come <LQ>completamente fuori di capa<RQ>.<N>Ieri ha litigato per un quarto d'ora col sasso su cui aveva sbattuto l'alluce. Ed ha perso. Invero, sono davvero fortunata a viaggiare in sua compagnia.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_00	 
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_10	3º giorno - addendum
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_20	Per correttezza, sono costretta ad ammettere che è anche l'uomo più coraggioso che abbia mai conosciuto. Il suo corpo è una ragnatela di cicatrici, anche se questo non è poi così sorprendente visto il suo rifiuto di coprirsi il torace con un qualunque genere di vestito o armatura. Immagino che alla fine il punto sia questo - è sia un pagliaccio insopportabile che un guerriero incredibilmente capace, e devo ammettere con riluttanza di essere contenta di averlo con me.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_30	<N><N>AWWW TI AMO ANCH'IO! XOXOXO<N>							<N><N>IO NON DORMO FACCIO SEMPLICEMENTE FLESSIONI DA SDRAIATO MI RASSODA I GLUTEI
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_40	<N><N>Inoltre, sembra che sia capace di leggere e scrivere! Dove mai avrà ricevuto un'educazione questo vagabondo sanguinario?<N><N><N>P.S. Se mi rubi di nuovo il diario, ti prenderò a legnate mentre dormi.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_1_00	3º notte - secondo addendum
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_1_10	Bene, per la cronaca, [berserker_hero] dorme nudo. Tutti i miei tentativi di vendetta d'ora in poi avverranno durante il giorno.<N>E, sì, le cicatrici non si fermano alla cintola.<N><N>Ti odio.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_1_20	<N>COME, CREDEVI CHE KHAN E CHARISSA NON COMBATTESSERO?
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_LEFT_0_00	3º giorno - Prigione
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_LEFT_0_10	Tre giorni fa, pensavo alla Valle come a una prigione.  Ora mi rendo conto che anche all'inferno si può trovare sempre di peggio.<N>L'uomo che ci trattiene si chiama Ozimal Kaz.  È un essere crudele, meschino, odioso.  Come un compatriota abbia potuto diventare così irrimediabilmente contorto va oltre la mia comprensione.  <N>Me lo sarei aspettata dai Quaid, che hanno trascorso gli ultimi due decenni a perfezionare la loro crudeltà sulle province orientali.  Anche il più spietato dei capotribù Nomadi controllerebbe meglio la sua furia assassina di questo degenerato.<N>E viene dalla capitale, a giudicare dal suo accento!  Questo mostro è cresciuto all'ombra del Tempio stesso!
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_RIGHT_0_00	Siedo qui con gli altri prigionieri, presi indiscriminatamente: briganti e banditi, uomini, donne, bambini, Ashiani, Nomadi, Quaid, tutti in attesa di morire per mano di quest'uomo.  <N>Giorno e notte udiamo i continui versi dei suoi Revenant, un'assordante cacofonia intervallata solo dai gridi di morte della loro ultima vittima.  Ed eccomi qua, incapace di fare qualsiasi cosa!  Se solo mi trovassi nel colosseo con quelle sfortunate vittime, almeno potrebbero avere una possibilità di combattere.  <N>Nonostante la sua spavalderia, Ozimal sembra esitare a farmi <LQ>giustiziare<RQ> una seconda volta.  Forse Ozimal teme di perdere troppi dei suoi Revenant - non possono essere facili da catturare o mantenere, e il suo insignificante impero sembra aver bisogno di loro per conservare l'ordine fra i suoi vassalli.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_LEFT_1_00	Le parole del mio misterioso complice continuano a risuonarmi nella mente.  Ozimal vuole dare una dimostrazione delle mie abilità ad un <LQ>Uomo in Rosso.<RQ>  Chi è quest'Uomo vestito di Rosso?  E chi è questo misterioso straniero così determinato a salvarmi?  Perchè sono importante?  <N>In questo fiume di domande sono certa di una cosa: fino ad ora ho recato violenza solo a coloro che già erano morti, ma se mai dovessi mettere le mani su Ozimal, questa linea di condotta sarà oggetto di cambiamento.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_HALFWAY_WORLD_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_HALFWAY_WORLD_LEFT_0_00	4º giorno - Il Mondo di Mezzo
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_HALFWAY_WORLD_LEFT_0_10	<LQ>Mondo di Mezzo<RQ> è il meglio che le mie deboli parole possono fare per descrivere il luogo in cui mi sono ritrovata - ed in cui ho attirato altri.<N>Una volta, quand'ero molto giovane, sono quasi annegata mentre nuotavo nelle secche del Kevel.  È l'unica esperienza con cui possa tracciare dei paragoni.  Vi è lo stesso panico, la stessa agonia del non poter respirare mentre il cuore cerca di balzarmi fuori dal petto.  Ma questa volta la mano di mio padre non mi trascinerà in salvo.  Non c'è riva a cui aggrapparsi, solo il momento della morte teso verso l'eternità.<N>La dinamica di come arrivi in quel luogo va oltre la mia comprensione.  So solo che è lì che vado quando ce n'è bisogno.  Una volta là posso sentire i miei compagni, non con la vista, ma allo stesso modo in cui sono coscente di mie braccia e gambe senza bisogno di guardarle.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_HALFWAY_WORLD_RIGHT_0_00	So semplicemente che sono lì e li chiamo con la forza che ho.  Questa forza è poca, ed esercito questi poteri con la fiacchezza di un neonato che sta imparando a muovere il suo corpo, ma è quanto basta a salvarmi la vita.  Per quanto odi avventurarmi in quel terrificante mondo di mezzo, è certamente meglio del destino che mi aspetterebbe altrimenti.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_LEFT_0_00	5º giorno - <ranger_hero>
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_LEFT_0_10	Credo che la cosa che mi piace di più di <ranger_hero> è che puzza come una capra.<N>Voglio dire, è una scelta difficile considerate tutte le sue altre piacevoli caratteristiche, come un'immaturità sfrenata, i continui commenti denigratori, sarcasmo idiota, la propensione ai piccoli furti, e delle abitudini alimentari orribili, ma quando dividi la tenda con qualcuno, è il pungente odore di capra che trionfa sul resto.<N>Certe notti la brezza soffia attraverso la zona del campo degli uomini, trasportando tra le sue braccia ariose l'inconfondibile odore di [berserker_hero]. Il risultante miscuglio di aromi può solo essere descritto come ambrosiale. È in quelle notti che dormo il sonno migliore, come se il mio corpo scegliesse di sprofondare nell'incoscienza piuttosto che tentare di elaborare gli stimoli aromatici che battono alle porte dei sensi.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_RIGHT_0_00	8º giorno - Addendum
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_RIGHT_0_10	Ieri notte <ranger_hero> mi ha svegliato gridando qualcosa in dialetto Nomade. L'urlo significava più o meno <LQ>Lui è mio, donna di dubbia moralità!<RQ> Poi mi ha strappato una ciocca di capelli, l'ha messa sotto il cuscino, ed ha prontamente ripreso a dormire.<N><ranger_hero> si è mostrata insolitamente pentita, arrivando addirittura a mostrarmi come intrecciare crine di cavallo ai miei capelli per nascondere il punto calvo. Dichiara di non avere idea di che genere di sogno abbia provocato il suo scatto. Io rimango scettica.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AZRA_BY_SLAK_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AZRA_BY_SLAK_LEFT_0_00	10º giorno - [mcguffin_hero] è una sfigata!
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AZRA_BY_SLAK_LEFT_0_10	ALLORA CREDI CHE SOLO PERCHÈ NON RIESCO A CAPIRE IL TUO LINGUAGGIO FORBITRICO VUOL DIRE CHE NON MI ACCORGO CHE STAI SCRIVENDO DI ME?<N>BEH INDOVINA UN PO', PRINCIPESSA? ORA SCRIVIAMO NOI SU DI TE!<N>COSA DIRE DI [mcguffin_hero_up]? CHE HA LA FACCIA COSÌ STRETTA CHE SEMBRA UN PESCE? E POI HA IL COLLO TROPPO TROPPO TROPPO LUNGO.<N>E LE SUE ORECCHIE SEMBRANO ALBICOCCHE APPASSITE. E HA I CAPELLI BRUTTI E STOPPOSI. E IL SUO IGIENE PERSONALE NON È PERFETTO COME CREDE.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AZRA_BY_SLAK_RIGHT_0_00	CHE TE NE PARE, SFIGATA? ORA CREDO DI SAPERE CHI SONO I MIEI VERI AMICI.<N><N>CORDIALMENTE,<N>[ranger_hero_up] A CUI PIACE MANGIARE POPÒ EHI [berserker_hero_up] PERCHÈ CI METTI COSÌ TANTO A SCRIVERE IL MIO NOME?
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KARSK_BURNED_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KARSK_BURNED_LEFT_0_00	7º notte - Il rogo di Karsk
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KARSK_BURNED_LEFT_0_10	Non sono estranea alla morte. Nove mesi di pestilenza nella capitale mi hanno spogliata di qualunque infantile ignoranza che la mia posizione privilegiata mi aveva concesso sull'argomento. Ma mai avevo assistito a una così violenta distruzione. Anche le pire dei cadaveri fuori dai Cancelli del Tempio impallidiscono al confronto. <N>Non ho parole.<N>Ora capisco qualcosa sulla natura del nostro nemico.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LAKSOS_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LAKSOS_LEFT_0_00	8º giorno - Laksos
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LAKSOS_LEFT_0_10	Siamo stati testimoni di uno strano rituale nomade mentre eravamo a Laksos. Il capo dei Karada, una piccola ma efficente tribù, ha appena avuto un figlio. I genitori hanno presentato il bambino di fronte a due grandi idoli di legno. <N>Il capo ha tirato fuori un piccolo blocco di legno, che ha poi poggiato sulla testa di ciascun idolo e poi su quella del piccolo. Ha poi preso un coltellino ed ha intagliato il blocchetto, lasciando cadere i trucioli sul volto dell'infante. Dopo aver finito il lavoro, ha appeso l'intaglio a dei tendini di animale e l'ha messo al collo del bambino. <N>C'è stato un enorme grido e tutti insieme gli uomini della tribù hanno cominciato a danzare, cantare e celebrare rumorosamente alla tipica maniera dei nomadi. Non sono riuscita a vedere che cosa ha intagliato il capotribù.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LAKSOS_RIGHT_0_00	Più tardi ho chiesto a <ranger_hero> il significato del rituale e lei mi ha fatto vedere una piccola volpe di legno che tiene appesa al collo. Ha detto che il suo spirito serve gli dei della sua tribù, e che le è stato dato alla nascita come protettore e guida, e per essere seppellito con lei alla morte allo scopo di garantirle un passaggio sicuro per il Paradiso. Proprio come gli dei tribali sono stati donati dal Creatore al momento della fondazione della tribù, così gli spiriti guida vengono dati alla nascita a tutti i suoi membri. <N>Ho chiesto a <ranger_hero> se per un individuo perdere il proprio idolo personale sia catastrofico come perdere gli idoli tribali per la tribù. Ha sorriso e mi ha mostrato sette idoli presi da nemici, spiegando che ora le loro anime avrebbero impiegato un'eternità a trovare il paradiso da sole. Ho chiesto se si sentisse in colpa per aver fatto questo ad altri nomadi e mi ha lanciato un'occhiata vacua, mi ha chiesto se mi sento in colpa per avere le orecchie troppo grandi e se n'è andata canticchiando qualcosa a proposito di mangiare lingue di capra. Un giorno o l'altro finirò per tirarle in testa una pietra.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_OZIMAL_DEAD_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_OZIMAL_DEAD_LEFT_0_00	10º giorno - La morte di Ozimal
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_OZIMAL_DEAD_LEFT_0_10	<N>Credevo che avrei avuto un po' di soddisfazione dalla morte di Ozimal. Non è stato così.<N>Era solo un altro strascicante cadavere dagli occhi vitrei piegato al volere del nemico, una marionetta anche prima di morire.  Il mondo si è disfatto di un uomo malvagio e crudele.  Qui nella Valle, qualcuno noterà la differenza?
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MONASTERY_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MONASTERY_LEFT_0_00	10º notte - Il Monastero
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MONASTERY_LEFT_0_10	Suppongo sia stato sciocco da parte mia aspettarmi di trovare nella Valle qualcosa che ricordasse casa, ma è stato comunque scioccante vedere il monastero Selini qui.  È un'imponente, minacciosa struttura, più fortezza che tempio.  Capisco la necessità di tali precauzioni, ma è difficile riconciliare tutto questo con il ricordo della Fontana del Tempio con cui sono cresciuta, dove persino le guardie portavano solo armi contundenti per non seminare scompiglio e distruzione nel luogo dell'armonia.<N>Che cosa rassicurante era immergere le mani nella Fontana, sapendo di trovarmi nello stesso luogo di tutti i credenti prima di me, fino a risalire allo stesso Selinadt.  Lì ero un'umile servitrice, separata da re e profeti soltanto dal tempo.<N><LQ>Proprio come l'acqua si leva sulla valle come nebbia, cade come neve sulle montagne, scorre in fiumi fino al mare, così ogni uomo, nato dalla stessa essenza, deve servire
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MONASTERY_RIGHT_0_00	i differenti ruoli del suo tempo e della sua condizione, e così arrivare all'armonia all'interno dell'Apparato Celeste.<RQ><N>Mi chiedo ora che ruolo mi spetta in questo terribile e anarchico luogo, dove armonia e saggezza sembrano fantasticherie remote.<N>C'è un po' di conforto, suppongo, in questa fortezza-tempio.  Questi monaci non svolgono forse il loro compito?  Queste imponenti mura e le difese militari non sono altro che gli adattamenti che permettono allo spirito di Selinadt di poter essere servito anche in questo luogo senza legge.<N>Proprio come lui disse una volta, <LQ>La verità rimane la verità, in qualunque linguaggio venga scritta.<RQ>  Queste difese non sono altro che il linguaggio della Valle; la verità al suo interno rimane autentica.<RQ>
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BAKAL_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BAKAL_LEFT_0_00	11º giorno - <healer_hero>
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BAKAL_LEFT_0_10	Il Reverendo <healer_hero> rappresenta un oasi di buon senso in questa terra caotica.  Anche se l'urgenza della fuga lascia poco spazio alla conversazione, le poche fugaci parole che abbiamo scambiato hanno enormemente sollevato il mio spirito.<N>Vorrei poter fare lo stesso per lui. C'è una qualche angoscia interiore che lo tormenta.  Posso vederla ribollire, ogni tanto, dietro il suo placido volto di monaco. È evidente che una volta era un soldato: le cicatrici, il portamento e le maniere accennano tutte ad una vita da guerriero.  <N>Nel monastero ho scoperto che non fa veramente parte del clero, ma tutti lo chiamano comunque Reverendo Anziano.  In verità, non ricopre nessuna posizione di autorità, o almeno non in veste ufficiale.  E tuttavia i suoi pari cercano regolarmente il suo consiglio e lo seguono come se fosse un loro superiore.  Persino lo stesso Abate sembra essere un suo fedele discepolo.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BAKAL_RIGHT_0_00	La presente avventura sembra sia agitare che ispirare <healer_hero>, come se la sua anima in qualche modo fosse in bilico.  Posso capire perchè <ranger_hero> ne ha paura.  Ogni tanto vedo nei suoi occhi una determinazione che rivaleggia con quella del nostro inseguitore.  Spero solo che un giorno <healer_hero> possa trovare per sè la pace che regala agli altri.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNA_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNA_LEFT_0_00	13º giorno - [mage_hero_fu]
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNA_LEFT_0_10	La descrizione di Polimon dei reali del Quaid non è un'esagerazione. [mage_hero] è davvero <LQ>più pallida della luna e due volte più distante.<RQ> Se mi è permesso aggiungere il mio parere, scriverei anche <LQ>quattro volte più volubile.<RQ> Non ho mai visto nessuno attraversare così tanti stadi della pazzia così velocemente. Persino [berserker_hero] è coerente nella sua follia. [mage_hero] è un oceano in tempesta, un istante sembra diabolicamente scaltra e il prossimo irrimediabilmente ingenua. Spesso le sue azioni danno l'impressione di una farsa ben congeniata, e tuttavia proprio quando mi convinco che i miei sospetti sono fondati, lei viene colta da una qualche infantile e pericolosa follia a cui nessuna mente razionale si esporrebbe volontariamente. <N>A volte dietro questa follia credo di poter scorgere una ragazza molto simile a me: spaventata, sola e oberata da un potere terrificante. Mi chiedo se anche lei riesce a vedere questo lato di se stessa.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NOMADS_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NOMADS_LEFT_0_00	14º giorno - I Nomadi
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NOMADS_LEFT_0_10	È stato molto interessante vedere di persona le tribù dei Nomadi, la popolazione indigena che occupa le steppe e le montagne tra le città Ashiane e l'Impero Quaid. Oltre un centinaio di tribù distinte furono documentate da Kantimal Polimon durante il suo grande viaggio verso oriente, anche se credo che molte di queste siano state estinte dalle devastazioni della guerra. Qui nella Valle ho incontrato membri di ventisette* diverse tribù, quante altre sopravvivano nel mondo esterno è impossibile da dire.<N>Come suggerisce il nome, le tribù vivono nomadicamente, allevando  capre e cavalli nelle steppe. Ben poco di questo stile di vita si è tradotto nella Valle, dove la protezione richiede difese permanenti.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NOMADS_LEFT_0_20	*meno della metà sono tribù autosufficenti.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NOMADS_RIGHT_0_00	Le tribù meglio organizzate creano villaggi come Karsk, ricavando il necessario per vivere dalle pecore e da una rudimentale agricoltura. <N>Nomadi indipendenti (le cui tribù sono state distrutte o disperse) troveranno rifugio negli insediamenti più cosmopoliti come Laksos, o diventeranno ranger - trasportando messaggi e e proteggendo il commercio tra i villaggi della Valle.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM1_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM1_LEFT_0_00	15º giorno - Strano sogno
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM1_LEFT_0_10	È passato molto tempo dall'ultima volta che ho sognato.  Le terrificanti sensazioni del mondo di mezzo sembrano dominare così tanto il mio spirito che anche nel sonno non provo nient'altro che i loro echi.  Tuttavia ieri notte, per la prima volta dalle visioni febbrili della mia malattia, ho sognato.<N>È stato un sogno così intenso da scacciare dalla mia mente tutti gli orrori di cui sono stata testimone.  In verità, tutte le esperienze dei miei 23 anni sembrarono svanire al suo cospetto.  <N>Mi trovavo su un alto terrazzo.  E non ero me stessa.  Le mie braccia erano scure e modellate, coperte da strani simboli e ornate da bracciali d'oro.  La mia veste era una moltitudine di gioielli, e la ricchezza di un'intera nazione non sarebbe bastata a costituirne niente di più che l'orlo.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM1_RIGHT_0_00	La luna pendeva bassa in cielo, enorme e d'un rosso acceso.  Potevo allungare il braccio e sfiorarla con la punta delle dita.<N>Una voce mi ha chiamato ed io mi sono voltata.  C'era un uomo vicino a me nel balcone.  Era alto, l'uomo più che abbia mai visto.  I suoi capelli e barba erano scuri come la notte, lunghi e adornati di anelli d'oro.  La sua presenza rendeva il mondo piccolo e vacuo.<N>Mi ha guardato con quegli occhi color onice ed ho capito che eravamo una cosa sola. Ho tirato giù la luna di fuoco e l'ho divisa tra noi.<N>Mi sono svegliata tremando, portando la mano al cuore come se ancora stringesse quella luna rossa.  Sono stata presa da un così grande senso di perdita che ho pianto.  Nel momento del risveglio avrei dato qualunque cosa per ritornare nel sogno.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DESERT_FORTRESS_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DESERT_FORTRESS_LEFT_0_00	17º giorno - Gioiello-del-Deserto
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DESERT_FORTRESS_LEFT_0_10	<N>Spesso mi sono chiesta che aspetto potessero avere le case dei nostri grandi nemici dell'Est. La guerra sembrava un terrore intangibile nella capitale, comunicata solo attraverso gli infausti rapporti sulle perdite quotidiane e i lamenti dei numerosi reduci che, rimasti storpi, chiedevano l'elemosina nelle strade. <N>Dopo una vita di paura senza forma, la vista di una vera città Quaid è una strana esperienza. Sono colpita dalla bellezza e l'ingegno delle sue forme, ma più di ogni altra cosa, sono scioccata dalla sua familiarità. <N>Vedo tutti i dettagli che segnano la vita di una città: i ciottoli consumati delle strade molto trafficate, il monumento arricchito dal vandalismo di generazioni di giovani, le bancarelle del mercato sistemate come in qualunque altra città.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DESERT_FORTRESS_RIGHT_0_00	Non è per niente difficile immaginare il mio stesso padre seduto all'angolo della strada, ridendo, bestemmiando e scambiando storie con gli altri anziani della città. <N>E tuttavia gli abitanti di questo posto hanno distrutto Terna e ucciso tutti i suoi abitanti, uomini, donne e bambini.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOS_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOS_LEFT_0_00	18º giorno - [knight_hero]
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOS_LEFT_0_10	Sono così abituata alla compagnia dei pazzi da non credere più nella normalità?<N>[knight_hero] è cortese, intelligente, generalmente ben intenzionato, a volte persino divertente - diamine, crede addirittura nell'igiene personale... ed io continuo ad aspettare di perdere anche l'altra scarpa.<N>Ci dev'essere qualcosa che non va in lui!  Qualche vizio, qualche stranezza, qualche irrazionalità.  Se ho imparato una cosa da tutta questa avventura, è che la normalità non esiste nella Valle.<N>Sono i baffi, vero?  Sta nascondendo tutte le stranezze dietro i mustacchi.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LETTER_MARKOS_1_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LETTER_MARKOS_1_LEFT_0_00	19º giorno
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LETTER_MARKOS_1_LEFT_0_10	A Lady [mcguffin_hero] Livbar da [knight_hero_fu] Kashantir, cavaliere della Compagnia di Ash.<N>Signorina, con il massimo rispetto della vostra posizione di comandante del gruppo, vorrei sollevare qualche perplessità sui vostri compagni.  Nello specifico, non posso garantire la vostra sicurezza, ovvero la sicurezza dell'intera spedizione, fino a quando continueremo a viaggiare con [mage_hero_fu] Lan Laxmi.<N>Potreste assicurarmi che lei <LQ>non è così male<RQ> e che la guerra col Quaid è finita, ma vi assicuro che per lei decisamente non è così.  È fanaticamente devota a qualcosa che non esiste più.  Non c'è una gerarchia di comando in grado di tenere a freno la sua follia.  Se [mage_hero_fu] credesse che tagliarci la gola durante il sonno sia necessario per gloria del Quaid, nessuno nella nostra compagnia vedrebbe la prossima alba.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LETTER_MARKOS_1_RIGHT_0_00	Vi suggerisco che tagliare ogni legame con lei il più presto e delicatamente possibile.<N>Il vostro umile servitore,<N>[knight_hero_fu] Kashantir
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LETTER_MARKOS_2_TITLE	
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LETTER_MARKOS_2_LEFT_0_00	19º notte - Lettera a [knight_hero_fu], bozza n. 1
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LETTER_MARKOS_2_LEFT_0_10	Caro [knight_hero_fu],<N>In risposta alla vostra lettera, vorrei sollevare tre punti.<N>Primo, perchè mandarmi una lettera, quando sarebbe bastato fare tre metri e parlarmi di persona? C'è qualcosa che non va nel mio igiene personale?

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NIRU_LEFT_0_10	Ho sentito parlare di draghi molte volte. Da bambina erano un'ossessione di mia cugina, che divorava avidamente qualunque leggenda potessi trovare in biblioteca, dagli assiomi scientifici di Polimon ai racconti popolari dei Nomadi.  Queste storie venivano poi a me rigurgitate nella maniera tipica dei bambini: al contrario e alla rinfusa e senza fermarsi a respirare.  Nonostante la qualità delle lezioni, una gran parte di quel materiale si è adagiato nei recessi della mia memoria.  Ora che sono in compagnia di un drago in carne e ossa, i ricordi di quelle lezioni infantili si rifanno prepotentemente vivi.<N>Nel corso di questa avventura ho imparato ad aspettarmi di trovare i miei preconcetti completamente inadeguati rispetto alla realtà.  Tuttavia, in questo caso trovo il mio bagaglio di conoscenze perfettamente accurato: [dragon_hero] è una grassa, avida, egoista, presuntuosa lucertola troppo cresciuta, dedicata ad accumulare tesori e alludere alla sua divinità.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NIRU_RIGHT_0_00	Una creatura così potente è in effetti un pericolo molto tangibile.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM2_LEFT_0_10	Il sogno è ritornato da me ieri notte.  It was a different form, but I could tell it was the same dream - o almeno ero la stessa sognatrice.<N>Mi trovavo in una grande sala.  Le sue mura si allungavano sopra di me, torreggiando così in alto che il soffitto era fatto di nuvole.  Ogni muro era d'oro splendente e adornato con meravigliosi gioielli a perdita d'occhio.  Nelle mie mani c'era un calice, intagliato da qualche materiale lucente, scuro come il vino e freddo al tatto.  <N>Nonostante tutte le meraviglie che mi circondavano, tenevo al calice molto più di ogni altra cosa, portandolo in modo da non versare una singola goccia dal suo orlo. All'improvviso la sala si fece scura e una lurida plebaglia la invase. Mi colpirono e maltrattarono e presero il calice dalle mie mani. Urlai, e sfoderai una daga affilata dalla mia veste, tagliando e colpendo finchè la sala divenne scura come il sangue.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM2_RIGHT_0_00	Nonostante le perdite la folla continuò a incalzare, finchè fui costretta ad abbandonare la sala, finendo in un'anticamera semibuia. Continuai a combattere, ma tutt'intorno l'orda rispondeva ai colpi fino a quando fui completamente sconfitta. Caddi a terra, e la marmaglia mi travolse, impaziente di strappare i brillanti gioielli dalle mura. <N>Rimasi lì per lungo tempo, credendo di essere morta. Quando finalmente riuscii a rimettermi in piedi, la sala era vuota. Le mura erano state abbattute e spaccate, e tutto era coperto di fuliggine e sporcizia. Ho cercato, ma il calice non era da nessuna parte. Ho vagato la sala per un'eternità, piangendo, ma ero sola. Il calice mi era stato portato via. <N>Sedetti tra le rovine e piansi.

È la prima volta che uccido un uomo in carne e ossa.<N>[mage_hero] oscilla tra la gioia e la rabbia, maledicendo il suo nome come se potesse di nuovo uccidere il defunto.

Stavo piangendo.  Le lacrime scorrevano giù sulla mia pelle, attraverso l'oro e gli amuleti, sino ad arrivare a terra.  Serpeggiarono sulla terra polverosa verso il cristallo, e in quel momento mi sono resa conto che non erano lacrime ma rivoli di sangue.  <N>C'era un ammasso di cadaveri ai miei piedi - uomini, donne e bambini.  Le mie mani erano ricoperte del loro sangue.  Mi sono girata e ho visto un esercito dietro di me, coperto, come lo ero io, di sangue.  Aspettavano che io parlassi.  <N>Ho alzato le mani al cielo e gridato con voce di tuono.

Ma perchè dovrebbe?  Quale rispetto merita la malvagità?  Quest'uomo dorato non è nient'altro che un bullo aggrappato alla divinità.  C'è qualcosa di profondamente patetico in questo genere di malvagità.  Puzza della stessa autosuggestione dei sedicenti uomini di potere.  Basta guardare questo posto: un intero palazzo dedicato a rinforzare la sua egocentrica immagine.  Guardatemi, sembra dire, io sono l'incarnazione del vero potere.  Eztli-Tenoch il dio, impotente nella sua gabbia di cristallo.<N>E nondimeno c'è un'altra parte di me che capisce.  Una parte di me che ha già camminato in queste sale, che ha conosciuto la divinità.

Lo scorso mese ha voluto vedere praticamente tutti i saggi militari che potessi trovare e, avendo esaurito gli argomenti pertinenti, si è spostato verso praticamente qualunque cosa potessi tirar giù dagli scaffali.  Credo che l'ultima cosa a cui si è dedicato sia un manuale per l'allevamento dei furetti che potrei giurare ha preso totalmente a caso, e poi ha passato l'intera visita a parlare con me invece di leggere.  Sapevo che anche lui doveva avere qualcosa di strano.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ACTQUOTES_LEFT_10	Some of my favorite things to write were the little bits of flavor text that opened each act of the story. They really let me experiment with other voices and give the player little glimpses into the larger world that the story was set in. When it came to start act seven, I actually came up with three different quotes and then picked a favorite to use in the game. Here are the two that didn't make the cut:<N><N><LQ>When faced with a decision, the selfish man thinks on a multitude of outcomes, weighing which option will yield him the best return.  The true man thinks only of which will serve the Flame.<RQ><N>- From the Book of Seven Wisdoms on the Path of the Blade<N><N><LQ>I look at the faces of our Northern mercenaries and I see the despair of a man who has gambled and lost.  We shall all die, but I shall die for my home, for my family, for the King and the Temple.  They shall die for a paltry sum of gold.<RQ><N>- Unknown defender, Siege of Karedon's Pass
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ACTQUOTES_LEFT_1_00	introductory bit of flavor text was taken from Thief: The Dark Projekt, one of my favorite games of all time. I don't think I've ever played anything else that had such a lavishly imagined, nuanced, and hauntingly beautiful setting. Master thief Garrett silently slipping through the shadows of The City, amidst grinding industrial machines and occult horrors, passing unseen through the warring factions of magic and reason is an image that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Sometimes I cry when I think about it. Although, that may have more to do with all the paint I ate as a kid...
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ACTQUOTES_RIGHT_0_00	The one that finally made it into the game is this:<N><N><LQ>It is said that men fear death.  In my experience, what men truly fear is the uncertainty of death.  In all that ordeal, when death was the only conceivable outcome, I was possessed by an unassailable calm I have never felt before or since.  It was only when the chance of survival appeared that I felt the true grip of terror.<RQ><N>- from the Memoirs of Gedemon Dalavbar, Master of Archers, being a History of his Adventures and Exploits in Service to the Ash King<N><N>This quote was highly inspired by a passage from Shadow of the Torturer, by Gene Wolfe, which I began reading as I was finishing work on Defender's Quest.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ASHTEMPLE_LEFT_00	The Temple of Ash
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ASHTEMPLE_LEFT_10	The Temple of Ash is a monotheistic-based monarchical religious philosophy centered on balance and community. The world is seen as a great machine, functioning under the impetus of the Unmoved Mover, the creator who sets everything in motion. The role of the individual is to serve their purpose as a part of the greater machine, being in balance with their place in the world around them. Evil is seen as the failure to do so, or imbalance. (This place is dictated by social structure – great emphasis is placed on the chain of command or chain of being.) The center of the religion is the physical High Temple, which was once the school of the founding philosopher. Water is a key element in Temple rituals, the hydrological cycle being an example of an element in balance with its purpose in the great machine. After death, those who have fulfilled their purpose within the Earthly Machine are taken by the Unmoved Mover and made part of the Celestial Machine, the perfected version of the earth.<N>The Temple of Ash was founded by Selinadt, an exiled philosopher from one of the distant northern
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ASHTEMPLE_LEFT_1_00	 
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ASHTEMPLE_RIGHT_0_00	independent city states. Banished from his homeland through the machinations of his political rivals, Selinadt wandered south, offering his services to various local rulers as an advisor. The King of Ash took him in after he defeated the king's wisemen in a riddle competition. After the conversion of the King of Ash, Selinadt's religious philosophy became widely popular throughout the region.<N><N>Since the King of Ash was the very first convert, each of his successors is seen as the caretaker of the Temple. The religion is practiced throughout the smaller neighboring kingdoms, but the High Temple at Ash is its center. For this reason, Ash is understood to be completely neutral in the wars that break out amongst its neighbors. In the few occasions that one of its neighbors has threatened it, the others have joined together against it to defend the Temple. This neutrality has allowed Ash to grow as a robust trading center, increasing its power and influence greatly. With the threat of the Quaid Empire, Ash's smaller neighboring kingdoms have united as a defacto federation, making Ash a sizable, albeit fractured empire.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BERSERKERS_LEFT_10	Boy, it sure looks cool when a killer swordsman keeps his awesome sword on a scabbard on his back instead of on his side like a normal person! So cool, in fact, that I initially designed the Berserkers to look like this.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BERSERKERS_LEFT_1_00	the coolness of drawing things from your back that they've designed special sheaths that exist only to do this. They're this weird kind of half scabbard sort of thing and they look stupid and they are stupid only stupid people use them and they still won't work as well as drawing it from your side. (A lot of them actually put a big metal ring right at the top, so you do get that metal-on-metal shing noise… You know, because this big metal ring is grinding the edge off of your sword.)<N><N>Anyways, the point is people are obsessed with how <LQ>cool<RQ> it looks to draw your sword from your back even though it will never, ever – even if you designed some sort of super sheath with this express purpose in mind – work like drawing it from your side like a normal person.<N><N>Fortunately, I corrected my grave error, and now all of our Berserkers use correct, physiologically possible sheath placement. Then I spent two hours watching German Longsword Fencing videos on YouTube and weeping for my sins.

(One of the Roman emperors that I'm too lazy to look up at the moment – Hadrian, I think? – actually bragged in one of his writings that London was such a subjugated city his troops could walk through the streets with their weapons on their backs. Because… if there was danger of you getting attacked… you'd want to have your weapons where you could actually reach them.)<N><N>Next time you see some movie where some super cool dude keeps his sword on his back (or better yet, two swords), watch closely when he draws it. You'll notice the film always conveniently cuts – he gets a couple inches out of the scabbard (with the appropriate metal-on-metal shing noise that by the way would only ever happened if something was scratching the crap out of your blade) and then magically it cuts to him with the sword all the way out. This is because the in between part is anatomically impossible – you can't draw anything longer than your arm from your back. At least, not without dislocating something.<N><N>Now, there are some people who are so obsessed with
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BERSERKERS_RIGHT_1_00	PS: You'll notice, in 3-D games where characters keep a sword on their backs, that the sword magically clips through the sheath rather than being drawn through the mouth of it.<N><N>PPS: some Napoleonic and the Victorian military sabers feature metal sheaths with a metal spring in the mouth that presses against the blade to keep it snugly in place, so when drawn they do actually create that metal-on-metal shing noise that the movies love so much. This spring also wears on the blade, so if you find still extant sabers of this variety, they will oftentimes have significant blade wear where the spring has rubbed against them every single time they're drawn. So yes, that cool shing noise does come from something, however it's very limited, and still bad for the swords long-term. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go flog myself while reading sword and buckler fencing manuals.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BLOODMAD_LEFT_10	The Nomads are actually the scattered remnants of an ancient civilization that was once part of Eztli-Tenoch's domain.  When Eztli-Tenoch was defeated most of them scattered, becoming the tribal, nomadic, polytheistic people that we are familiar with.  But some of them remained loyal to their defeated <LQ>god,<RQ> and, under the leadership of their mysterious Queen, grew into a shamanistic death cult dedicated to freeing Eztli-Tenoch from his prison.  These tribes surrounded the areas around Eztli's prison and set about breaking the blood seal in the only way they knew how: killing anyone they could get their hands on and painting the Great Stone with their blood, hoping that one day, they would manage to nab the right people.  People learned very quickly to avoid these areas, so the Blood Cults spread out, eventually into the territory of the Quaid Empire.  Obviously, having everyone on your highways ritualistically murdered isn't good for business, and certainly not good for the glory of the Cosmic Flame, so the Quaid Empire waged several wars of eradication against the cults (these are the ones that Wrenna refers to).

With the disappearance of their Queen centuries ago, the cults began to lose much of the reasoning behind their actions to complicated ritual. Most blood cults no longer orbit the actual Great Stone, and instead worship and sacrifice to smaller replicas of it.  However, with Eztli Tenoch being somewhat freed from his prison, he has reached out to his long lost children.  The shamans of the blood cults have heard his call, and are all leading their people back into the Pit, back to the Great Stone prison of their god.<N><N>The cultists maintain a poisonous diet (the same poisons Zelemir used on Ozimal) and a crazed mania that they believe to be filled with the spirit of their master. This poisonous diet allows them to transform themselves into revenant as needed.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BOSSREVENANT_LEFT_00	Boss Revenant
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BOSSREVENANT_LEFT_10	For those of you who are curious about our boss revenant, here's an explanation from one of our internal design documents:<N><N>Some revenant may be more powerful than others, depending on how much spiritual focus the wizard is giving that particular pawn. Furthermore, some <LQ>shells<RQ> are more conducive than others. For instance, a powerful necromancer could inhabit the corpses of squirrels. And while an army of zombie squirrels would be pretty hilarious, squirrels do not have the same depth of spiritual existence that humans do – less of the their being is in the shadow realm. Basically, the bigger a void left by a soul, the more room there is for the wizard to fill it with his own spiritual focus (ideally as soon as the thing dies – as a corpse rots, so does its spiritual dimensions, so the older a corpse gets, the less it can do). This carries over to people as well. Not everyone has as much room for the wizard to work in. Shallow vessels can only carry a small amount of his spirit, and won't allow him to do things that require more energy

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BOSSREVENANT_RIGHT_0_00	than they can hold. On the other hand, some people have significantly more spiritual depth and allow him a lot more room to work in – the newer a corpse is, the more spiritual void is left for him to fill.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CHIEFTANSTUNIC_LEFT_10	The twisting roots of the World Tree that decorate the Chieftain's Tunic was part of my many efforts to imply a deeper culture and folklore to our various factions, in this case the Nomads.<N><N>A lot of real-world cultures have the concept of a World Tree, but I was inspired specifically by a very strange bit of Greek folklore I read about which involved some Balkan goblins called Kallikantzaroi. The Kallikantzaroi spend the entire year underground, sawing at the roots of the World Tree in hopes of causing it (and therefore the world) to collapse. The Kallikantzaroi are just jackasses like that, I guess. Anyways, the only time they stop trying to kill the world is on Christmas, which arrives just as they are about to saw all the way through the World Tree. Starting on Christmas, they get to come up to the surface and run around peeing in people's beer, stealing candy from babies, sticking your toothbrush in the toilet, and generally being ass-clowns of the highest caliber. All their fun ends on the day of
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CHIEFTANSTUNIC_LEFT_1_00	 
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CHIEFTANSTUNIC_RIGHT_0_00	Epiphany, when they are banished back down into the earth. They arrive to discover that the joke is in fact on them and the World Tree has healed entirely from all of their sawing. This happens every single year, because the Kallikantzaroi aren't just ass-hats, they're incredibly stupid ass-hats. (I like to imagine that the World Tree went and peed in all of their beer while they were gone.)<N><N>Oh, and if you want to protect your beer, baby-candy, and toothbrushes from the Kallikantzaroi, all you have to do is put a colander out on your porch. Kallikantzaroi can only count as high as the number two – since three, being the number of the Trinity, is a holy number, if one of the Kallikantzaroi says it out loud, they will immediately die. So if you stick a colander on your porch, those punk ass Kallikantzaroi will stay up all night trying to count all of the holes in it but always losing count after the number two. Then you just get up first thing in the morning, bust out your trusty .45, cap those tragically math-obsessed fools in their collective keister, put the bodies down the garbage disposal, and enjoy urine-free beer for the rest of the holiday season. At least, that's how I imagine it going down.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CUTCHARS_LEFT_00	Cut Characters: the Paladin and the Protector
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CUTCHARS_LEFT_10	We were originally going to have an even larger party roster, but had to cut characters in order to keep things at a more manageable size. Among the guys that ended up on the chopping block were the Paladin and the Protector.<N><N>The Protector was going to be a heavily defensive <LQ>tank<RQ> type unit who carried a massive shield. His whole shtick was that he could shield, not just himself, but also nearby allies. So when a defender next to him would have normally gotten hit, the Defender would zap in and block the shot with his shield. Story wise, if I remember correctly, the Protector was going to be part of an elite fanatical military unit from Ash that believed it had a moral obligation to defend any land on which one of its members had shed blood. Elements of the Protector were recycled for Markos the Knight, although the more fanatical <LQ>Our blood! The blood of patriots!<RQ> aspects were left on the cutting room floor.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CUTCHARS_LEFT_1_00	 
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CUTCHARS_RIGHT_0_00	The Paladin also had a lot of overlap with the Knight, and was similarly axed. This is actually the class that Wrenna was originally going to be – the <LQ>fanatical and warlike enemy princess turned reluctant ally<RQ> seemed a perfect fit for someone with a sword. When this class ultimately got cut, I decided the enemy princess character was too good to not use somewhere, and the Ice Mage we all know and love was born.<N><N>While we're on the subject of classes that got changed, the Dragon was originally going to be the Dragon Rider. This absurdly overpowered unit would've been a dragon with an archer riding on its back. As is, Archers are one of the most overpowered classes in the game, so the Dragon Rider was scaled back to a plain old Dragon. I think Niru appreciates it.

The <LQ>realm<RQ> we will be dealing with the most is the <LQ>shadow<RQ> realm, as it is called by the characters. The shadow realm is the dimension of spirit – something like the platonic ideal, but for each object in existence.

All in all, the Imperial Cult is a fairly sophisticated monotheistic religion centered around fire worship.<N><N>The Imperial family is seen to be the chosen children of the Cosmic Flame. By bringing glory to the Quaid Empire the children earn the right to join their progenitor in the afterlife. The names of Imperial family members who have brought glory to the Empire in some way are recorded on a great stone wall in the Imperial Palace Complex – this functions as something of a ritualistic passport, signifying that they have the right to proceed to the afterlife. Those that have failed to bring glory to the Empire in some way during their lifetime are stricken from all historical records and their body is buried rather than cremated – an incredible dishonor, since cremation is the only way to join the Cosmic Flame.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_MARKOS_NAME_LEFT_10	Markos' name actually comes from a very weird story a good friend of mine was told by one of his professors at St. Andrews. The professor, in his much younger days, had once gone on a tour of Europe. While in France, he visited one of the many medieval cathedrals available to the public. He was so entranced by the structure that he decided it would be a good idea to slip out of his tour group and hide so that, after everyone left and the cathedral closed, he could sneak around and look at everything without some pesky tour guide telling him where he could and couldn't go.<N><N>His plan worked, and as soon as the cathedral and shut down for the day, he slipped out of his hiding spot and began perusing. It was around this point that he noticed a pair of feet poking out from behind a tapestry. As it turned out, he was not the only one with a grand idea of secretly admiring medieval architecture. The person behind the tapestry turned out to be one of the young women from his same tour group, and the two of them began exploring the cathedral together.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_MARKOS_NAME_LEFT_1_00	 ways. The future professor and the young lady eventually got married. Markos, I like to believe, is living in a grotto under a cathedral somewhere, painting himself blue.<N><N>I liked the character so much, I decided I had to work the name Markos into something at some point.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_MARKOS_NAME_RIGHT_0_00	The two of them, distracted talking with each other, did not notice the arrival of a third-party until he asked them if they would like a <LQ>secret tour.<RQ> The man, who identified himself as Markos, had wild hair, an untrimmed beard, and long fingernails. He apparently made a regular habit of hiding in cathedrals until they closed and then exploring them at night, and was full of all kinds of behind-the-scenes information, even going so far as an impromptu performance on the church organ. It was around this point that he explained that many medieval Christian cathedrals were actually built on older pagan sites, and that oftentimes these pagan sites still existed below the later structure. This was actually his primary interest in cathedrals, as he was a druid. After some time spent exploring the back of the church, he successfully located an important looking hatch in the floor that opened into the catacomb that ran underneath the cathedral. Apparently seeing nothing wrong with following a strange man into a subterranean death chamber, the two tourists joined Markos underground, where they found the remnants of the pagan tomb that the church had been built on top of. After playing with the skulls a little bit, Markos bid them a good night, and everyone went their separate

This is because the game has a list of physical characteristics for each civilization as well as a list of culture-specific names – when the player clicks to recruit a character, the game first randomly picks one of the three cultures for the recruit to come from and then picks a random name and physical characteristics from that culture's lists.

Having a small population that mostly marries within itself means that unusual genes, such as red hair and green eyes, tend to show up more often. Quaid names - lots of W's and L's, taking inspiration from Welsh and Hawaiian without being obviously one or the other (mostly because I was looking for letters that the Ash names weren't using prominently and L and W seemed to be it.) There's also a dash of Anglo-Saxon influence. Quaid uses the letter C rather than K, and often uses Y as a rounded I. Female names tend to end in -a and often <LQ>-nna.<RQ>

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NOMADSPIRIT_LEFT_00	Nomad Spiritualism
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NOMADSPIRIT_LEFT_10	Originally, the Nomads practiced a tribal based polytheism. Each tribe has it's own gods (and among many tribes, each individual family has a subset of lesser household demi-gods) represented by idols. These gods are there to serve the tribe's interests, but must also be honored and served in return. Infighting and feuds are very common among the different tribes, as the constantly moving nomads often encroach on one another's turf, or take to rustling or raiding. The tribal gods serve as standards in these fights. For a tribe to lose it's idols is the ultimate disgrace, and (unless the tribe can regain the idols through warfare) generally signals the end of that tribe's existence. A tribe without it's gods is considered the lowest of the low, and shunned from trading and other meetings.<N><N>Each individual Nomad is also given a personal idol at birth, which is believed to be a servant of the tribe's gods. These servant spirits act as the individual’s guide and guardian through life. At a Nomad's death, the personal idol is buried with its owner in order to guarantee safe passage to Paradise. For a Nomad to lose

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NOMADSPIRIT_RIGHT_0_00	their personal idol is a catastrophic event. Without its guardian spirit to lead the way, the Nomad's ghost is doomed to spend many ages looking for the path to Paradise.<N>    Prolonged exposure to the Ash Kingdom through trade, etc. has led to many of the tribes picking up the teachings of the Temple of Ash. Only a handful have been willing to fully abandon the old ways and completely join the Temple of Ash. The majority attempt to reconcile Ash's deity with their own. This muddling of the faith has created a lot of religious animosity from the Temple of Ash, adding to the general prejudice against the Nomads in the Ash Kingdom.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_STORYINSPIRE_LEFT_00	Story Inspirations
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_STORYINSPIRE_LEFT_10	A fellow English major once asked me what the literary inspirations for the story of Valley of the Forgotten were. For the other two of you that would be interested in these things, here's the top three things that were on my mind when I was writing:<N><N>The plague colony concept actually came from one of Rudyard Kipling's short stories, The Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes. I read it when I was 11 or 12 and the idea of a naturally shaped prison full of people that had <LQ>died<RQ> but recovered has stuck with me ever since. There's this very strong sense of a plague society that inspired some of the details in the Pit. (For instance, the fact that there are no horses. One of the first things that happens to Morrowbie is that his horse is killed and eaten - although he gets a share of the meat, so it's not all bad.)<N><N>Beyond that, a lot of the cultural flavor came from Byzantine historical records. Much of the Selini culture is based on the writings of the early desert fathers and
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_STORYINSPIRE_LEFT_1_00	 
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_STORYINSPIRE_RIGHT_0_00	other early Eastern Christians.<N><N>And just to round out my history lit nerdom, a HUGE inspiration was Anglo-Saxon literature. I had just taken an Old English course when I started working on Defender's Quest and the language and culture were a gigantic inspiration for almost everything. The very pensive, elegiac tone seemed perfect for our kind of Medieval post-apocalypse setting. I highly recommend checking out The Ruin, if you're at all interested in that sort of thing; it's short and really encapsulates the kind of memento mori vibe of Anglo-Saxon literature.<N><N>Of course, there's a ton of stuff beyond that, but those three were probably the biggest influence on the setting. Well, those and a healthy dose of my favorite humor writers.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_WARRIORMONK_LEFT_00	The 9th Branch of the Selini, House Militant, Defenders of Truth and Order
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_WARRIORMONK_LEFT_10	One of the major inspirations for the Ash religion – and especially the Selini like Bakal – was Eastern Christianity. As I was writing, I began to grow worried that the inspiration was a little too obvious. I desperately wanted to avoid cutting and pasting a real world religion wholesale into a fantasy universe, rather than creating a fantasy religion that felt like an organic part of its world.<N><N>I started looking for places where the Ash philosophy would deviate from my inspirations, how values would've evolved unique to this setting, etc. One of the things that immediately sprung out to me was pacifism. Eastern Christianity, while still allowing for some low level of necessary violence, has an incredibly pacifistic vibe. Clergy are banned from killing for any reason – even self-defense. (Self-defense is also frowned at among laymen.) Priests must be able to officiate a
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_WARRIORMONK_LEFT_1_00	 monks, a caste-based chain of being governing its social order, a very Deist feeling Unmoved Mover, hydrological rituals, etc., I began to feel confident that the Ash Temple was becoming its own thing, rather than a rehash of real world religions.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_WARRIORMONK_RIGHT_0_00	<LQ>bloodless sacrifice<RQ> when performing the Liturgy, the central focus of church life. (In fact, if a clergyman is involved in an accidental death – say a fatal car accident – he can never serve again.)<N> This seemed like an element that wouldn't necessarily work with the Selini philosophy that I created so far. It would be entirely conceivable, given the Ash religion's focus on order, that violence could actually be seen, at points of absolute necessity, as being a sacred duty. Sometimes, a broken part must be removed before it damages the rest of the machine. Who would be better equipped to carry out this task than warrior Selini? While the Selini would only view violence as a final resort, there would be no taboo against clergy or monks being its dispensers, as the religion I'd created had none of the <LQ>bloodless sacrifice<RQ> at its centerpiece that Eastern Christianity did.<N><N>And that's how we got warrior monks, which didn't even really figure in the game, but hey, they're there in the background.

We were sifting through the remnants of our fallen foes, looking for salvageable gear, when I found an item of a most peculiar nature.<N><N>It was similar to a lamellar harness, or what was left of one, with scraps of the thin gambeson that had once been worn beneath it. The plates were smaller, and their connections more intricate, than anything I have seen in our own armies or those of the Quaid.

This attempt at secrecy suggests to me that the armor in question was civilian, rather than military in origin.<N><N>The largest mystery posed by the harness is the damage which, lamentably, renders it unusable by our party. There is a hole, more than a hand's breadth wide, roughly where the wearer's heart would have been

Still holding my wrist, he took his knife and cut open the seam of the gambeson. Inside were a row of sharp needles. He continued cutting down the length of the sleeve to reveal more hidden barbs. All told, there were 32 of them, each tipped with poison, sewn into the outer layer of fabric where one might grab an attacker's arm.<N><N>As [knight_hero] continued his dissection, we discovered a thin pocket, stitched into the sleeve's wrist. Inside was a piece of parchment, rolled on itself. The illustration was not unlike the many illuminated manuscripts I handled back in the great Library of Ash, though foreign in the style. Despite significant damage, the image is still discernible: a slender woman sits on a throne. Her face is obscured by scorch marks, but long white hair runs down her shoulders and mingles with the jewels around her neck. At her feet sit two boys, dark-skinned and golden eyed. The woman rests her hands on the boys' heads. Their hair, like hers, is white.

The once powerful institution of matriarch had given way to a disorganized ruling class of high priests, each eager for his own power more than the good of the whole. Without the centralized authority of the <LQ>Queen of Many Devils<RQ> (as the Quaid termed the office), the cultists were unable to provide a unified resistance, and fell under the might of the Quaid offensive.<N><N>Until the coming of the plague years, [mage_hero] and her people had believed the blood-cultists all but exterminated.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BOOKKEEPING_LEFT_0_10	After freeing the last prisoners from Ozimal's pathetic den, I must confess that I derived a shameful amount of enjoyment from raiding the wretch's personal quarters. His few remaining guards had fled at the sight of our victory over their trained revenant, leaving the petty tyrant's chambers ripe for plunder. We procured as much as we could carry from his private larder, acquiring sausages, oil, and a significant quantity of cheeses to help us on our journey. I would have liked to set fire to the rest, but I feared the resultant smoke would betray our position, and hasten the return of the villain and his army. As if sensing my frustration, [berserker_hero] took it upon himself to <LQ>desecrate<RQ> the remaining foodstuffs. He then went on to desecrate the bed, a large section of the floor, and some of the walls. It was not an act one of my station or sex should approve of, but I find it difficult to not grin when I think of the unpleasant discovery awaiting Ozimal on his return.<N><N>[berserker_hero] must imbibe truly astounding quantities of water.

On Ozimal's lecturn, I discovered (just prior to the <LQ>desecration<RQ>) several scraps of parchment which made up the bookkeeping side of his base empire.

To feel nothing was the most joyous fantasy… I embraced oblivion.<N><N>From that embrace there came a bitter joy. I drew my hands back and found they each held a small flame.<N><N>I wept again.

I turned and saw before me a small candle, meager and dim, fluttering in the cold night wind.

While the various necessities a company such as ours has have been met by the same assortment of merchants and tradesmen found in every settlement of the Pit, the people here feel unsound. They are Quaid, mostly, and carry themselves with such a quiet fervor I find myself secretly cataloging escapes whenever one of their number addresses me.<N><N>[knight_hero], especially, seems agitated.

I had believed myself to be a true and ardent follower of Selinadt (a pride that I see now as itself a grave fault.) But surely, I reasoned, one such as I – steeped in verses from childhood, regular patron of the Temple – could consider herself on the righteous path? Despite this, I secretly held throughout my life the delusion that evil was something purely external. First it was the Quaid, architects of all the pain and misery I ever saw throughout my early life. While I read daily about the evil in my own heart, I secretly told myself that none of it could compare to the evil of the armies of the East, murderers and ravagers, men who had made themselves animals. All around me the lamentation of widows, the weeping of orphans, the cries of crippled veterans, all the keening of the city was made by my selfish mind into words of affirmation.

Seeking to terrify the rest of Ash into submission, they swore that no quarter would be offered to the beleaguered defenders. On that black day when the city fell, we saw that oath to be true. But the enemy was not content with the massacre of the garrison and turned their fury on the populace, disregarding age, youth, and sex in their senseless rage. By the day's end, thirty thousand men, women, and children lay slaughtered. Terna was nothing but ashes, populated by scarcely enough souls to recount the horror of what was done there.<N><N>For this reason is my every tenth prisoner burned alive. Until thirty thousand die by my hand, the immolations shall continue, for the edification of the prisoners and the achievement of true balance. This is my solemn oath by the very gold of the Fountain, and not even the threats of a misguided cleric shall keep me from honoring it.<N><N>– General Keznimon Kalredos

No matter the secret thoughts of my heart, I could point to Ozimal or Zelemir and say <LQ>there is the true evil.<RQ><N><N>The way of Selinadt, in usual circuitous faction, has showed to me the grievous folly of my secret beliefs.

I look at the horror on the page before me and I see the vilest sin. But how easy it would have been to commit. How sweet it would have felt to drink deeply from that secret stream in my heart, to inflict the pain and loss, to feel my soul dance with the dark joy of revenge.

Hence, this journal.<N><N>I had never fancied myself a traveler; all of my 23 years were occupied in the capitol and its surrounding locales. My childish wanderlust was sated by the written word.<N><N>In those idle moments of daydream when I did entertain fantasies of travel, I always thought it would be to our Western brethren. How interesting it would be to follow the Temple pilgrims on their homeward journey, men of the mountains, dark as Nomads, and beyond them men darker still, people of the sea, all united by the way of Selinadt.

([berserker_hero], having finished with the revenant, spent the remainder of the day savagely depopulating the water of all other occupants.) While the resultant feast of broiled fish has most pleasantly filled my belly, it is one of the revenant corpses that fills my mind.<N><N>Of all that vile host we purged from the river, one carcass stood out from the rest. He had once been a herald of no small importance, judging by the quality of his dress, and the strange pattern and cut of his attire leads me to believe he hailed from one of the many Northern city states. While the rest of his accoutrements were far too damp-rotted to be of any use, he bore on his belt a watertight capsule of waxed leather. Inside, I discovered a still legible piece of parchment.<N><N>The contents validate my theory as to the man's origin. The text appears to be written in one of the many

Despite the obscurity of the dialect, he was able, within only a few moments, to present me with a translation of the text's opening line:<N><N><LQ>Return to me, my beloved,<RQ> Further progress was considerably slower, and the resulting interpretation far from complete, but a strange picture has begun to emerge.

It is a great comfort to me, even if it is also a great selfishness, to shut out the dark and bloody world which has become my life, and dedicate my energies wholeheartedly to the deciphering of some mysterious manuscript. If I close my eyes, I can almost feel myself back at the Library.<N><N>On my own, I have already been able to tease out several details, despite my ignorance of the language. I see, repeated several times, what appears to be a group of glyphs borrowed from the Nomad (a tongue which, at the risk of sounding boastful of my linguistic prowess, I shall admit to possessing a meager command of). It roughly translates to <LQ>ornamented woman,<RQ> or <LQ>Queen<RQ> (as I have seen it used in some texts), though perhaps <LQ>Woman of Many Symbols<RQ> would be closer to the literal meaning. The arrangement of the text around it
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MANUSCRIPT_RIGHT_1_00	From there, [healer_hero] tells me the language becomes increasingly difficult, and the few words he can understand seem such gibberish that he begins to doubt his accuracy. <LQ>What voice have I to challenge the one you now hear?<RQ> is the only other complete statement [healer_hero] is able to produce. The remainder of the text is a mystery we cannot pierce, save for a word which [healer_hero] says could mean either <LQ>gray<RQ> or <LQ>dust,<RQ> several repetitions of the phrase <LQ>you return to blood,<RQ> and many uses of the proper name I discovered previously.<N><N>Hearing me say the name out loud, [ranger_hero] has corrected my understanding of the Nomad loan. In the Northeast (where it seems this manuscript originates), the word for <LQ>symbol<RQ> has somewhat different connotations. According to [ranger_hero], a more accurate translation of the phrase would be <LQ>Woman of Many Mystic Charms.<RQ> The magical quality of the woman has, sadly, not granted me any new insights into the text. All I can say is that she had, at the very least, bewitched the author's heart. Judging by the wealth apparent in his messenger, this Carcassian King (as I would guess) spared no expense in

Its guard was already dead.<N><N>Still holding my arm, the Carcassian entered the general's tent, drawing me after him. The general lay on a cot at the far end, surrounded by maps and scrolls and other accoutrements of command. Even lying down, I could tell he was a giant of a man, head and shoulders taller than I, and larger still than the slender Carcassian. Releasing me, the Shade Drinker crept to the general's foot. From some unseen sheath, he produced a small knife. He held it over his head for a moment, and it seemed to me time hung still. With a sudden jerk, he brought the knife down into the sleeping Quaidman.<N><N>The general sprang to his feet with a gasp. The knife still protruding from his ribs, he seized the Carcassian by the shoulders and hurled the smaller man across the tent. Drawing his sword from where it lay next to his cot, the Quaidman closed the distance between them with a single step. Fearing for my companion's life, I drew my sword and made ready to strike the advancing giant. My blow was checked by the strange sound of the Carcassian's laughter.

In the worn leather of the grip were carved strange characters. I looked up, and he was flanked by another four figures, clad and black-toothed smiling as he was. As one, they stepped backwards, into the mist and out of view.<N><N>Our commander choked to death in his sleep several weeks later, and the story spread throughout all the men that it was the Shade Drinker come back for his payment.<N><N>Years later, I met another soldier educated in some of the languages of the Carcassians.

His guards were few, the spies said, the time to strike was now.<N><N>Our commander was ill prepared for such an action. The bulk of his troops were untested recruits, my age or younger, and his Nomad auxiliaries were deserting at a steady pace. He had no reserves, no veterans to call on, and scarcely enough gold to field more than a handful of mercenaries.

With rising dread, I realized I was alone in the mist.<N><N>I wandered for a great time, stumbling in my blindness, terrified that every step would discover me to the enemy. Presently I came upon a form in the mist. He was a Quaid guard, dead, red with his own blood. He had no eyelids.<N><N>I had stumbled into the enemy camp, and I was not alone.<N><N>Ahead of me, crouched between two tents, was another figure.

I watched in the fear as the assassin reached out both his hands and began to make ablutions with the Quaidman's last ragged breaths, scooping them up and over his head and pouring them out as if they were water.<N><N>As the general's wheezing turned to silence, the Carcassian ended his ritual. He turned and saw me where I stood, still holding my undelivered blow. He made another black-toothed grin at me and peeled back the cloth on his shoulder to reveal a row of barbs, loaded with the venom that had taken his victim's life.<N><N>Taking my wrist again, he led me out of the tent, to the edge of the camp.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THE_FOX_LEFT_0_10	When I was a child, I once found a dying fox in the gardens that surrounded the Royal Library. How this wild creature had reached the heart of the city is a mystery to me, but his presence had caused the silent patrons to forsake their meditations and attack the small beast with stones and fallen branches, their anger turning the gardens around them into an armory. Broken and bloodied, the fox had dragged himself into an alcove to die. I could hear his small whimpering breaths from the path where I walked with my mother. I darted away and slipped into the doorway of the alcove. The fox froze at my appearance. The whimpering stopped in his red mouth. He met me with a silence containing more pain and anger than any warning growl ever could. His eyes stayed locked with mine as my mother pulled me back to the path and out of view.<N><N>I am reminded of that moment as I sit here waiting in vain for sleep to take me.
